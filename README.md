# NaviGuide: Senior Capstone Project

NaviGuide is a navigational system designed to provide visually impaired individuals with independence in their day-to-day indoor tasks. The project uses a robot and computer vision to map designated areas within the home and provide auditory instructions to avoid obstacles. To meet the demands and scope of the project, a prototype was created that used red cones as obstacles for demonstration purposes.
